Using HTTPS URLs: If you are using HTTPS URLs, Git may ask for your username and password each time you interact with the remote repository. To avoid this, you can configure Git to store your credentials using a credential helper. For example, you can use the cache or store helpers. The cache helper stores your credentials in memory for a short period, while the store helper stores them in a file. 

To use the cache helper, run:
git config --global credential.helper cache

To use the store helper, run:
git config --global credential.helper store


Clearing Cache: If you have previously stored your credentials and they are no longer valid, you may need to clear the cache or remove the stored credentials file. For the store helper, the file is usually located at ~/.git-credentials.
