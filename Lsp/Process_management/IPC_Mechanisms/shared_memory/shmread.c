int shmget(key_t key, size_t size, int shmflg);

DESCRIPTION:
shmget()  returns the identifier of the System V shared memory
       segment associated with the value of the argument key.  It may
       be  used  either to obtain the identifier of a previously cre‚Äê
       ated shared memory segment.

RETURN VALUE
       On success, a valid shared memory identifier is returned.   On
       error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.



SYNTAX: void *shmat(int shmid, const void *shmaddr, int shmflg);
shmat() attaches the System V shared memory segment identified
       by shmid to the address space of  the  calling  process. 
    
	
SYNTAX: int shmdt(const void *shmaddr);
shmdt()  detaches  the  shared  memory  segment located at the
       address specified by shmaddr from the  address  space  of  the
       calling process.
