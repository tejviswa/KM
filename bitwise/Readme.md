## 26-oct-2024 : Topic: Assignments on Bitwise operators


1. Write a program to Set, clear and toggle a particular bit using bit wise operator?
2. WAP whether a number is ODD or EVEN using bitwise.
3. Write a printbinary(int , int ) function consists of 2 integer variables. First one is the value of the variable and the second one is the size of the variable.
Example:
char x=5;
printbinary(x,sizeof(x));
output:  00000101
4. WAP to count the bits set (bit value 1 ) in an integer? Find out and compare different possibilities?
5. WAP whether a number is a power of 2 or not?
6. WAP implements subtraction functionality without using SUB('-') Operator.
7. WAP implements addition functionality without using ADD('+') Operator.
8. WAP implements XOR functionality without using XOR(^) operator.
9. WAP to implement the sizeof operation using the bitwise operator.
10. WAP to convert Little endian integer to Big endian integer
11. WAP multiply a number by 9 using bit shift.
12. WAP Check if the 20th bit of a 32-bit integer is on or off?
13. Write a functionsetbits(x,p,n,y)that return x with then bits that begin at position p set to the rightmost n bits of y, leaving the other bits unchanged.
e.g. if x = 10101010 (170 decimal) and y = 10100111 (167 decimal) and n = 3 and p = 6 then
you need to strip off 3 bits of y (111) and put them in x at position 10xxx010 to get answer
10111010. Your answer should print out the result in binary form although input can be in
decimal form.
Your output should be like this:
x = 10101010 (binary)
y = 10100111 (binary)
setbits n = 3, p = 6 gives x = 10111010 (binary).
14. WAP Swap any two numbers using bitwise operators. How does it work?
