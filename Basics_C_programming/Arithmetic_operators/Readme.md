1) Write a program that reads an integer and displays the right-most digit of the number.

(Eg: User enters, 456, the output should be 6).


2) read a 4 digit number and print it in the following formats Using Arithmetic Operators.

eg., 4532

OUTPUT1:

2

3

5

4


OUTPUT2:

4

5

3

2



OUTPUT3: 

4

4 5

4 5 3

4 5 3 2



OUTPUT4:

4 5 3 2

4 5 3

4 5

4


OUTPUT5:


2 3 5 4  



OUTPUT6:


          2

       3

     5

  4


3) Take three input integers x,y and z. Write a program to rotate their values such that, x has the value of y, y has the value of z and z has the value of x.


4) Input 3 digits, read them into three different characters. Make one integer out of them and display.

Eg., input 345.(stored as char c =‘3’,b=‘4’,d=‘5’.)

Output : int i = 345. ( store 345 in integer i and print the value of i as output).

hint: any digital character can be converted to a corresponding digit by subtraction with '0'.
